# Patient Clustering Using MIMIC-III Clinical Data

Cluster analysis of ICU patient demographics, lab tests, and vital signs to uncover hidden groups related to clinical conditions.

## Features
- Combined and cleaned MIMIC-III datasets (demographics, lab tests, vitals)
- Applied K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
- Used Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Dunn Index, and CH Index for model validation
- Visualized cluster separation based on physiological parameters

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Healthcare Analytics
- Data Normalization and Preprocessing
- Clustering Validation Metrics

## Insights
- Identified hypertensive vs. non-hypertensive clusters
- Discovered patterns across age and heart rate variations
